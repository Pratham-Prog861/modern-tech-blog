# React Is Easy... Until It Isn't

React's learning curve is deceptive. You learn JSX and props in a day, but then you hit the wall.

---

## 1. The "Stale Closure" Trap
One of the most confusing parts of `useEffect` is accessing old state values inside closures.

**❌ The Bug:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log(count); // 'count' is always 0!
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer);
}, []); // Empty dependency array
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Use a functional state update or add `count` to dependencies.

## 2. State Management Chaos
"Prop drilling" is annoying, but moving everything to Redux or Context without a plan creates a maintenance nightmare.

**Tip:** Start with **local state**. Lift it up only when needed. Use **TanStack Query** for server state.

---

## 3. Component Structure
Beginners often create "God components" that do everything.

**Tip:** Break UI into small, focused components.
*   `Button.tsx` (UI only)
*   `UserProfile.tsx` (Logic + UI)
*   `Dashboard.tsx` (Layout)

## Key Takeaway
Mastering React isn't about learning more hooks; it's about understanding the **lifecycle** and **data flow**.
