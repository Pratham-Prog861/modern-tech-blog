# Getting Started with TanStack Start

**TanStack Start** is a modern full-stack React framework focused on **server-first rendering**. It's built by the same team behind TanStack Query and Router.

---

## Why TanStack Start?
Traditional React apps (SPAs) push too much logic to the client. TanStack Start brings logic back to the **server** where it belongs, improving performance and SEO.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Server Functions
You can write server-side code directly in your components.

```tsx
// Server-side action
const greetUser = createServerFn('POST', async (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
});
```

### 2. File-Based Routing
Just like Next.js, your file structure determines your routes.
*   `routes/index.tsx` -> `/`
*   `routes/about.tsx` -> `/about`

### 3. Type-Safe Navigation
No more broken links. TanStack Start knows all your routes.

```tsx
<Link to="/blog/$slug" params={{ slug: 'my-post' }}>
  Read Post
</Link>
```

## Key Takeaway
TanStack Start encourages **better architecture** by default, giving you the power of a full-stack framework with the developer experience of React.
