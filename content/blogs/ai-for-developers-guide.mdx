# The Developer's AI Toolkit

Not all AI usage is created equal. Here's how to be smart about it.

---

## What to Use
*   **GitHub Copilot:** For autocomplete and pattern matching.
*   **ChatGPT / Claude:** For architectural brainstorming and refactoring ideas.
*   **v0.dev:** For generating UI components quickly.

---

## What to Avoid
*   **Pasting Sensitive Data:** Never put API keys or company secrets into public AI models.
*   **Blindly Trusting Output:** AI hallucinates. Always verify libraries and syntax.

## Where Humans Win
AI is bad at:
1.  **High-level system design**
2.  **Understanding business context**
3.  **Empathy for the end-user**

That is your domain.
