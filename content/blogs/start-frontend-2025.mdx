# How to Start Frontend Development in 2025

Frontend development is about building user experiences. Here is your roadmap.

---

## Step 1: Fundamentals (The Trinity)
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript.** No shortcuts.

```html
<!-- Semantic HTML is key -->
<article>
  <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
  <p>Content goes here...</p>
</article>
```

---

## Step 2: Pick a Framework
**React** is the industry standard.
*   Learn **Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`).
*   Understand **Props** and **State**.

---

## Step 3: Styling
**Tailwind CSS** is the fastest way to build UIs today.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
  Click Me
</button>
```

---

## Step 4: Build Projects
Projects teach more than tutorials ever will.
1.  **Portfolio Website**
2.  **Weather App** (API fetching)
3.  **Todo List** (CRUD operations)

---

## Key Takeaway
**Consistency beats speed.** Code a little bit every day.
