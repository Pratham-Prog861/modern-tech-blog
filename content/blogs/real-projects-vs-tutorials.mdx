# Why Real Projects Matter

Tutorials show the path. Projects make you walk it.

---

## 1. Real Problems
In a tutorial, everything works. In a real project, you will spend 4 hours fixing a **CORS error**. This is where real learning happens.

## 2. Architecture Decisions
*"Should I use Context or Redux?"*
*"SQL or NoSQL?"*

Tutorials tell you what to use. Real projects force you to decide **why**.

## 3. Dirty Code & Refactoring
Your first draft will be messy. Real projects teach you the value of **clean code** when you have to revisit it a month later.

---

## Key Takeaway
**Projects turn learners into engineers.** Stop watching, start building.
