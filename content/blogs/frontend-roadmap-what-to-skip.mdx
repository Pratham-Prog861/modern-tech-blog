# The 80/20 Rule for Frontend

You can't learn everything. Focus on what matters.

---

## ✅ What to Learn (High ROI)
*   **JavaScript Deep Dive:** Promises, Async/Await, Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
*   **React Patterns:** Custom hooks, Context API.
*   **TypeScript:** It's non-negotiable in 2025.
*   **API Integration:** Fetching data, handling loading/error states.

---

## ⛔ What to Skip (For Now)
*   **Complex Webpack Configs:** Use **Vite** or **Next.js**.
*   **Class Components:** Stick to **functional components**.
*   **Redux (Legacy):** Learn **Zustand** or **Context** first.
*   **jQuery:** It's history.

## Key Takeaway
Don't get distracted by the latest shiny tool. Master the **fundamentals**.
