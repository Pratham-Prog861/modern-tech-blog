# Backend Development for Frontend Developers

If you know JavaScript, backend is closer than you think.

---

## 1. Start with Node.js
Same language, new mindset. You run JS on the server instead of the browser.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello from the Backend!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

---

## 2. Learn HTTP Basics
*   **GET:** Retrieve data.
*   **POST:** Send data.
*   **PUT/PATCH:** Update data.
*   **DELETE:** Remove data.

---

## 3. Databases
Start with **MongoDB** (NoSQL) because it uses JSON-like documents. Later, learn **PostgreSQL** (SQL).

---

## Key Takeaway
Backend is about **data flow**, **security**, and **reliability**. It's less about pixels and more about logic.
