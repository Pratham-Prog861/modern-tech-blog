# How React Actually Works Behind the Scenes

Most developers use React daily, but very few understand how it truly works internally. It's not just magic; it's **engineering**.

---

## 1. The Virtual DOM
React creates a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI called the **Virtual DOM**.

**Why?**
Because manipulating the real DOM is slow. React updates the Virtual DOM first, which is fast.

```javascript
// Simplified Virtual DOM Node
const vnode = {
  type: 'div',
  props: { className: 'container' },
  children: ['Hello World']
};
```

---

## 2. Reconciliation (The Diffing Algorithm)
When state changes, React compares the **new** Virtual DOM with the **previous** one. It calculates the minimal set of changes needed.

*   If a node type changes (`div` -> `span`), React destroys the old tree and builds a new one.
*   If attributes change, it only updates those attributes.

---

## 3. The Fiber Architecture
Introduced in React 16, **Fiber** allows React to:
*   **Pause** rendering work.
*   **Prioritize** urgent updates (like user input) over background tasks.
*   **Reuse** work.

This is why React apps feel smoother even under heavy load.

## Key Takeaway
Understanding internals helps you write **performant** and **predictable** React code.
