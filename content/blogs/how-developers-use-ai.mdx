# How Developers Use AI to Code Faster

AI is a productivity tool, not a replacement for thinking. Here is how senior devs use it.

---

## 1. Generating Boilerplate
Don't waste time typing out standard setup code.

**Prompt:** *"Create a TypeScript interface for a User object with id, name, email, and optional phone number."*

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
}
```

---

## 2. Explaining Obscure Errors
Paste a weird error message into ChatGPT, and it often explains the root cause faster than a Google search.

---

## 3. Writing Regex
Nobody likes writing Regex. Let AI do it.

**Prompt:** *"Write a regex to validate a US phone number."*

```javascript
const phoneRegex = /^(([0-9]{3}) |[0-9]{3}-)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$/;
```

## The Golden Rule
**Never commit code you don't understand.** AI makes mistakes. You are the pilot; AI is just the co-pilot.
