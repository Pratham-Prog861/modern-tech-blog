# Common React Mistakes That Kill Performance

React is fast by default — unless you misuse it. Here are the top mistakes developers make.

---

## 1. Unnecessary Re-renders
Passing new objects or inline functions as props causes child components to re-render every time.

**❌ Bad:**
```jsx
<ChildComponent data={{ id: 1 }} onClick={() => console.log('click')} />
```

**✅ Good:**
```jsx
const data = useMemo(() => ({ id: 1 }), []);
const handleClick = useCallback(() => console.log('click'), []);

<ChildComponent data={data} onClick={handleClick} />
```

---

## 2. Huge Bundle Sizes
Importing huge libraries when you only need a small function bloats your app.

**❌ Bad:**
```javascript
import _ from 'lodash'; // Imports everything
```

**✅ Good:**
```javascript
import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'; // Imports only what you need
```

---

## 3. Not Using Keys Correctly
Using `index` as a key in lists can lead to rendering bugs and performance hits.

**❌ Bad:**
```jsx
{items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>)}
```

**✅ Good:**
```jsx
{items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
```

## Key Takeaway
**Premature optimization** is the root of all evil. Measure performance first, then optimize where it hurts.
