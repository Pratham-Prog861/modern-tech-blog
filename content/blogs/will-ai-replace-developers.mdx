# Will AI Take Your Job?

**Short answer:** No.
**Long answer:** It will change your job.

---

## The Shift
We are moving from **"writing code"** to **"architecting solutions."** The syntax is becoming cheap, but problem-solving is becoming more valuable.

---

## Adaptation is Key
Developers who refuse to use AI will be outpaced by those who do. It's a **productivity multiplier**.

> "AI won't replace developers. Developers using AI will replace developers who don't."

## The Future
Software demand is infinite. If AI makes us 50% faster, we won't fire 50% of developers; we'll build **2x more software**.
